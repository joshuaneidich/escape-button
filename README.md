# escape-button
Insert this code into the head of your website to cloak the site's visit and provide user's with a quick escape button
I built this function (loaded inside a <script> tag) inside the head tag of a wordpress based domestic violence nonprofit. The idea is to build a function that automatically replaces the current URL with the link's href so that if someone needs to use the escape button, there movements on the site will have been hidden.
